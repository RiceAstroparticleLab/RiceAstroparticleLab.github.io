# Rice University's Computational Astroparticle Group

The Computational Astroparticle Group at Rice University focuses on answering fundamental questions about the Universe by using advanced computational techniques, including machine learning, to gain insights in (astro)particle physics data. This group was founded in 2018 as part of two intiatives.  First, a joint initiative for a multi-facutlry Cosmology Cluster hire within the Department of Physics and Astronomy. Second, the Provost's University-wide Data Science Intiative where this group serves as the physical science effort.


Our research focuses on:
- Understanding neutrinos
- Investigating the nature of dark matter

## Latest News
- **October 2024**: New paper

## Physics Research Areas
We specialize in the following physics areas:
- **Dark matter direct detection**:  We are a founding member of the XENON experiments that is one of the leading experiments to measure WIMP dark matter terrestrially. (XENON100/XENON1T/XENONnT) 
- **Neutrinos and weak interactions**: We research neutrinos through processes such as neutrinoless double-beta decay, where observing this process gains insight into why the Universe is made of predominantly matter. (Dune / XLZD / Darwin)
- **Quantum sensing for dark matter**: We are pioneering efforts to understand how novel quantum sensing devices can be used to probe dark matter terrestrially.  (Windchime / Polonaise)
