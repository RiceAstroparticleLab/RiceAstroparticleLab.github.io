# Rice University's Computational Astroparticle Group

The Computational Astroparticle Group at Rice University focuses on answering fundamental questions about the Universe by using advanced computational techniques, including machine learning, to gain insights in (astro)particle physics data. This group was founded in 2018 as part of two intiatives.  First, a joint initiative for a multi-facutlry Cosmology Cluster hire within the Department of Physics and Astronomy. Second, the Provost's University-wide Data Science Intiative where this group serves as the physical science effort.


### Understanding the Universe with Data and Dark Matter Detectors

Our research group focuses on using advanced computational methods to explore cosmic mysteries, specifically the nature of **dark matter**, an invisible substance that makes up most of the universe's mass. We develop tools that bridge **computer science** and **physics**, a unique approach known as (translational computer science)[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9547673]. This approach allows us to create new computational techniques while working on critical questions about the universe.

#### Probing Dark Matter with the XENON Experiments
Our team is a founding member of the [XENON Collaboration](https://www.xenonnt.org/), a group of researchers from around the world using detectors located deep underground in Italy to search for dark matter. These detectors are some of the most sensitive ever made and have helped rule out many theories about dark matter. We use a special type of detector called a **liquid xenon time-projection chamber**, which allows us to detect faint signals from particles passing through Earth.

From 2018 to 2022, we used the [XENON1T detector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XENON1T_experiment), which was the most sensitive instrument for searching for **Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs)**, the leading candidate for dark matter. Since then, we’ve upgraded to a new experiment called [XENONnT](https://www.xenonnt.org/), which continues to push the boundaries of what we know about the universe. Our findings not only deepen our understanding of dark matter but have also led to discoveries in other areas of physics, such as rare particle interactions and neutrinos.

#### Bridging Physics and Computer Science
Unlike other groups working on dark matter, our approach emphasizes cutting-edge computational techniques. Most groups focus on developing hardware (e.g., detectors and sensors), but we invest heavily in using new **machine learning** and **data science** methods to solve problems in physics. For example, we have used **domain-informed neural networks** to make our detectors smarter and more efficient in understanding particle interactions. Our focus on software and algorithms has enabled us to develop new ways to improve the sensitivity of our experiments and enhance the speed of data analysis.

#### Community and Future Plans
We also play a key role in building a community of researchers working at the intersection of **data science** and **particle physics**. Through initiatives like [DIDACTS](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1940209) (Data-Intensive Discovery Accelerated by Computational Techniques for Science), we bring together experts from multiple disciplines to address data challenges across scientific fields. In addition, our [DANCE network](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Dark-matter+And+Neutrino+Computation+Explored) connects researchers globally to share computational advances for tackling big questions about dark matter and neutrinos.

#### The Future of Dark Matter Detection
Looking ahead, our group is contributing to the future of dark matter detection through projects like [DARWIN](https://darwin.physik.uzh.ch/) and [XLZD](https://xlzd.org/), which aim to be the most sensitive detectors yet, potentially helping us finally discover what dark matter really is. 

We are also pioneering novel approaches for using **quantum sensors** to search for dark matter, addressing fundamental questions about what it means to perform such a measurement, including related statistical, computational, and modeling challenges. One such project is [Windchime](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1832220), which aims to detect **heavy dark matter** (such as WIMPzillas) using **Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMs)**. This technology would allow us to observe dark matter gravitationally, providing a novel detection method for extremely massive particles.

Another frontier project is [Polonaise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03814), which focuses on using **magnetic levitation** to search for **ultra-light vector dark matter**. Polonaise leverages advances in quantum technology and metrology to achieve previously unreachable sensitivity, making it possible to explore a range of dark matter candidates that have never before been testable.

Our work combines frontier experiments with cutting-edge computational techniques to explore one of the greatest mysteries in physics: what is dark matter, and why does it exist? By pushing the boundaries of both **data science** and **experimental physics**, we hope to uncover new physics that will help us better understand our universe.
